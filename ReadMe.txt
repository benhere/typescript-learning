## TS Notes

# Note - Typescript's type system only helps you during development (i.e beofre the code gets compiled).

# The key difference between JS and TS is that JS uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), where as TS uses "static types" (set during development).

# Note - Often, we shall see enums with all-uppercase values but that's not must-do. We can go with any value names.
